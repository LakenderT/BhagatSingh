			<h2>Revolutionary Activities</h2>
			<p>Bhagat Singh and his comrades in the HSRA believed in armed struggle against the British colonial government. They carried out several acts of sabotage and assassinations of British officials, including the killing of British police officer John Saunders in 1928.</p>
			<p>In 1929, Bhagat Singh and two of his colleagues were arrested for the murder of Saunders.
